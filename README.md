Hello and welcome! This is the Github repository for the project titled as:
Responsive blog with an icon to switch between light and dark themes <br>

This is not a project of mine though. I'm using the original project as a case for web development study, <br>
therefore isn't of my interest to just copy over the original content, instead, my goal here is gain experience <br>
for web design and to learn how these beautiful blogs are made, and what features are the best option to this type of page,
from what are the best external resources such as icons or libraries to the code itself. <br>
<br>
As i previously stated, my main goal here is to learn the entire process of the development of such web pages,<br>
so even though this is not a project of mine, i guarantee you that any of those code lines (except for the root ones because it'd take too long and there's nothing to learn about that) were copied and pasted on this repo. I'd also wanted to highlight that i'm not getting the raw code from the source, instead i'm having a web development class
and following the professor as he do the steps and explains the meanings of each line of code.

Project is still under construction. Thank you for your patience.
